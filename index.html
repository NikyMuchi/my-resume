    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      Been working for customer Support Specialist with over 3 years of
      experience in telephone ,email, chat customer service, including sales.
      I'm really good at helping people. I've worked in customer service, which
      means I know how to answer questions, solve problems, and make sure
      everyone's happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      My strongest skills are the initiative and the ability to adapt to new
      challenges or ideas. I am used to work under pressure. I enjoy
      investigating cases for customers and finding the best solution to solve
      their issues, also following up their cases to make sure they are
      satisfied with the solution. <br />
      I can adapt to new situations easily. And I love working with others.
      Teamwork makes everything better, and I'm all about making things better!
    </p>

    <p>
      I've even dipped my toes into the world of coding! I can build websites
      from start to finish, which is like being able to create your very own
      space on the internet. <br />
      I can talk in three different languages! This helps me connect with people
      from all over the world, which is super cool.
